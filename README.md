## Notes
---
- Handy framework for developing a React app from scratch:
  1. Break the app into components
  2. Build a static version of the app
  3. Determine what should be `stateful`
  4. Determine in which component each piece of `state` should live
  5. Hard-code initial `states`
  6. Add inverse data flow
  7. Add server communication
- Ternary Operator:
```
condition?expression1:expression2
If the condition is true, the operator returns the value of expression1. Otherwise, it returns the value of expression2. In our example, the variable submitText is set to the returned expression.
```
